UI Examples is a package that adds a new 'UI Examples' section to your Umbraco instance with working examples of how to customise the backoffice. During installation the Administrators user group will be given access to the section.

https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/ui-examples/

Examples include:
- UmbBox
- Layout
- Dialogs
- Icons
- Buttons
- Tabs
- Editor Panels
- Alerts

> This repository contains examples of the current backoffice UI, which are not (yet) based on the new [Umbraco UI Library](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UI).

## Installing the Package 
Umbraco v13: install the NuGet package using `dotnet add package Our.Umbraco.UiExamples` *or* manually adding a `PackageReference` to your project file.
