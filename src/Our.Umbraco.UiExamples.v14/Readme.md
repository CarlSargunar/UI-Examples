# How this works

go into `src`  
run `npm ci`  
run `npm run dev`  

This will build the typescript, output it into the folder within the Umbraco14 website for use in there.

## Running the Umbraco14 website

In a separate terminal window, to run the umbraco project, open the path /samples/Umbraco14/

run `dotnet run`

You can then launch the umbraco solution and should see the new back office section.
